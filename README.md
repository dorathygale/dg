# thirdweb Telegram Mini App Example (Unity WebGL)

Easily embed your Unity WebGL blockchain game into Telegram Mini-Apps using thirdweb.

## Getting Started

> This project assumes some basic knowledge of Unity, TypeScript, Next.js App Router, and [Connect SDK](https://portal.thirdweb.com/unity).

## Environment Variables

1. Create your `.env` by running `cp .env.example .env` in both the `/next-app` and `/telegram-bot` directories.

2. Create a client ID from the [thirdweb dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/settings/api-keys) and add it to your `.env` as `NEXT_PUBLIC_THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID`. Follow the instructions in each `.env` file to set up your environment variables.

## Set the authentication endpoint

This project uses a powerful thirdweb feature called [Authentication Endpoints](https://portal.thirdweb.com/connect/in-app-wallet/custom-auth/custom-auth-server). It uses your own API endpoint to generate a wallet for users on successful authentication. All the code for this is written for you in this project, you'll just need to set the endpoint in your thirdweb dashboard.

> To use Custom Authentication Endpoints, you'll need to be on the Growth Plan. If you have questions about the plan options or want to try it out, [reach out to our team](https://thirdweb.com/contact-us).

Navigate to the [In-App Wallets](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/connect/in-app-wallets) page on the dashboard and select your project from the dropdown. **This should be the same project your `clientId` is from.** Then click the **"Configuration" tab** and scroll down to "Custom Authentication Endpoint" and enable the toggle. You'll then see a field to enter your endpoint.

While testing the project locally, you'll need a publicly exposed endpoint to authenticate through. We recommend using a tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/product/secure-tunnels) to create a public endpoint that forwards traffic to your local server. Forward your traffic to `http://localhost:3000` (where your app will run locally).

Once you have your ngrok or similar endpoint, add it to the Authentication Endpoint field as `[YOUR FORWARDING ENDPOINT]/api/auth/telegram`, the route this app uses to perform authentication.

You're now ready to run the project!

> **When you deploy to production (or any live URL), you'll modify this authentication endpoint to be your actual live URL. You could also create a separate thirdweb project for local development and production.**

### Run the project

You're now ready to test the project! First, you'll need to install the dependencies. Run the following command in both the `/next-app` and `/telegram-bot` directories:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Now, run `pnpm dev` in both the `/next-app` and `/telegram-bot` directories. This will start the Next.js app and the Telegram bot.

You should see the app at http://localhost:3000. Try messaging the `/start` command to the bot you configured with the Bot Father in Telegram.

Launching the app should have no effect at this point, we must create a Unity build to serve now.

## Building Unity for Telegram

Open the Unity example project, it already has thirdweb's [Unity SDK](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/unity-sdk) imported.

1. Open `Scene_TelegramExample`

2. Set the client id you previously created in your `ThirdwebManager`

3. Set the `EncryptionKey` in the scene's `TelegramIAWCustomAuth` to match the `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_PHRASE` previously set in your .env.

4. Build using your own WebGLTemplate or our provided MinimalFullScreen template. Unity SDK v5 has no strict template requirements.

5. Copy the Build folder's outputs to this repo's `/next-app/public/unity-webgl`. (It should have Build folder and index.html).

That's it, start the bot and you should see Unity load and after a few seconds, your wallet will be connected (default is Smart Wallet on Arbitrum Sepolia).

## How it works

The callback from the telegram bot starting passes the auth payload to unity through query params for simplicity.

From there, you simply use the Unity SDK's `InAppWallet` + `AuthEndpoint` login!

In this case, we take it one step further and upgrade it to a Smart Wallet, making gas sponsorship automatic and easy using ERC-4337 or zkSync Native Account Abstraction.

Note that you must run the Unity build from Telegram for it to work properly.

```csharp
var connection = new WalletOptions(
    provider: WalletProvider.InAppWallet,
    chainId: 421614,
    inAppWalletOptions: new InAppWalletOptions(
        authprovider: AuthProvider.AuthEndpoint,
        jwtOrPayload: JsonConvert.SerializeObject(payload),
        encryptionKey: EncryptionKey
    ),
    smartWalletOptions: new SmartWalletOptions(sponsorGas: true)
);
var smartWallet = await ThirdwebManager.Instance.ConnectWallet(connection);
var address = await smartWallet.GetAddress();
```
